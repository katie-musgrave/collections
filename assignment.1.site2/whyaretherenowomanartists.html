            <h1>WHY ARE THERE NO GREAT WOMAN ARTISTS?</h1>
            <br>

            <h3>georg baselitz, male contemporary artist, has something to say about this (in an interview with the guardian): </h3>
            <br> 
        <p>
        <div>
            <h2>"The market doesn't lie," he says. "Even though the painting classes in art academies are more than 90% made up by women, 
                <h1>it's a fact that very few of them succeed.</h1> <h2>It's nothing to do with education, of chances, or male gallery owners. 
                    It's to do with something else and it's not my job to answer why it's so. It doesn't just apply to painting, either, but also music. 
                    What does it matter so much? If women are ambitious enough to succeed, they can do so, thank you very much. 
                    But up until now, they have failed to prove that they want to. Normally women sell themselves well, but not as painters." </h2>

        <h6>linda nochlin, author of "why are there no great woman artists?" writes: </h6>
       <div>
           <h5>"There are no women equivalents for Michelangelo or Rembrandt, Delacroix or Cezanne, Picasso or Matisse, or even in very recent
                times, for de Kooning or Warhol, any more than there are black American equivalents for the same. 
                If there actually were large numbers of "hidden" great women artists, or if there really should be different standards for women's art
                as opposed to men's - and one can't have it both ways - then what are feminists fighting for? If women have in fact acheived the same 
                status as men in the arts, then the status quo is fine as it is. </h5>
    
        <br>
        <h4>But in actuality, as we all know, things as they are and as they have been, in the arts and as in a hundred other areas, are stultifying, oppressive, 
            and discouraging to all those who did not have the good fortune to be born white, preferably middle class, and above all, male.  </h4>

<h3>judy chicago, woman contemporary artist, also has something to say about this (in an interview with huffpost): </h3>
    <h2> "...how history is written, both in and out of art institutions, is how you shape the world. And so giving up control of that and rethinking that hasn't 
            happened. It's not enough to have a few women's studies courses. Why is it more important to study Paul Revere's Midnight Ride than it is Susan B. 
            Anthony's 50-year effort to transform the face of America for women? How off balance is that? <h1> Men really cannot conceive of what it's like to grow up 
                and look on television and see that all the major sports figures are male, all the major politicians are male. If you go to an art institution, most of 
                the art is by men. Men's activities louded and repeated over and over. What about us?</h1> <h2>What about commemorating the decades-long struggle for suffrage? 
                    Why don't we hear those stories over and over again. It's almost inconcievable for men to understand what it would be like to live without that constant valorization...</h2>  
<br>
    <h2>Let's look at MoMA. I read the "Designing Modern Women" catalogue and I went to the show and when I walked in saw signs for Matisse, Monet, etc. All men. And then there 
    was a small sign for "Designing Modern Women." <h1>One of the things happening in major institutions like that, which are the pillars of the phallocentric narrative in art, 
        is that they are trying to figure out how to include more women and artists of color without disturbing the existing narrative."</h1>
